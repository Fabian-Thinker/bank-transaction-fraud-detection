# Bank transaction fraud detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent bank transactions using a machine learning approach. The workflow consists of two main steps:

1. **Clustering Model**: Used to analyze and group transactions based on patterns to identify potential fraud cases.

2. **Classification Model**: Built after labeling the dataset to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
